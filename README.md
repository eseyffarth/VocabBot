# VocabBot
Twitterbot that asks vocabulary questions, adds new vocabulary items tweeted at it and tells users if their answers are correct.

## Example Twitter Account
I made [@FrenchVocabBot](https://twitter.com/FrenchVocabBot) with this. Have a look! It asks questions every hour and reacts to answers/new vocabulary additions every 5 minutes.
